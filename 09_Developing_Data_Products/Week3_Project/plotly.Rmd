## Load `plotly`

First we need to load the library:

```{r message=F}
library(plotly)
```


## Plot some data

We want to plot the `trees` data set from the `datasets` package with a
regression line relating volume to height. Additionally we'll change the color
of the points by the diameter of the tree (falsely labeled as `Girth` in the
data set).

```{r plot, message=F, fig.show='hide', results='hide'}
data(trees)

m <- lm(Volume ~ Height, data=trees)

plot_ly(trees) %>%
        add_markers(x=~Height, y=~Volume, type="scatter",
                    color=~Girth, name="Volume ~ Height") %>%
        add_trace(x=~Height, y=predict(m),
                  mode="lines", name="Regression Line")
```

The plot is on the next slide.

***

```{r ref.label="plot", message=F, echo=F}
```
