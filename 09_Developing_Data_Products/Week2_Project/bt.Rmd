This map shows the location of the infamous [Bermuda
Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle) in the western part of
the North Atlantic Ocean. In other words it shows, where you shouldn't go on a
boating trip. It is loosely defined by the area between the island Bermuda;
Miami, FL and San Juan, PR.

If you hover over the objects on the map, a tooltip appears -- magic :o).

```{r echo=F,message=F}
library(leaflet)

edges <- data.frame(lat=c(32.271682, 25.787777, 18.451656),
                    lng=c(-64.797158, -80.224165, -66.068867),
                    label=c("Bermuda", "Miami, FL", "San Juan, PR"))

edges %>%
        leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(label=edges$label) %>%
        addPolygons(lat=edges$lat, lng=edges$lng, label = "Bermuda Triangle")
```
